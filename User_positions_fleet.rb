# The user fleet consists of 5 ships:
#     - 1 Aircraft Carrier ("C"), 5 squares long by 2 wide
#     - 2 Destroyers ("D"), 4 squares long
#     - 1 Submarine ("S"), 3 squares long
#     - 2 Minesweepers, 2 squares long

# Visually these will be represented on the grid by their corresponding letter, e.g for a Carrier:

# AA
# AA    AAAAA
# AA or AAAAA
# AA
# AA
